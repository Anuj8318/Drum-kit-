## How It Works
Event Listeners:
For mouse clicks: Added to each button with the class drum.
For keyboard presses: Captures keypress events.
Sound Playback:
A makeSound function maps button presses or keypresses to specific drum sounds.
Animations:
The buttonAnimation function adds and removes a CSS class (pressed) to visually highlight buttons when they are clicked or activated by a keypress.
## Future Improvements
Add more drum sounds and keys.
Include a recording and playback feature.
Optimize for mobile gestures (e.g., swipes and taps).
Add visual drumstick animations.
